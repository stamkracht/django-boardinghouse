If django 1.7 or greater is installed, wrap the included ``flush`` command
to ensure:

* the clone_schema function is installed into the database.
* the ``__template__`` schema is created.
* the search path to ``public,__template__``, which is a special case
  used only during DDL statements.
* when the command is complete, all currently existing schemata in the
  SCHEMA_MODEL table exist as schemata in the database.
