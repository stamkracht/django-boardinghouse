class SchemaMiddleware:
    """
    Middleware to set the postgres schema for the current request's session.

    The schema that will be used is stored in the session. A lookup will
    occur (but this could easily be cached) on each request.

    There are three ways to change the schema as part of a request.

    1. Request a page with a querystring containg a ``__schema`` value::

        https://example.com/page/?__schema=<schema-name>

      The schema will be changed (or cleared, if this user cannot view
      that schema), and the page will be re-loaded (if it was a GET). This
      method of changing schema allows you to have a link that changes the
      current schema and then loads the data with the new schema active.

      It is used within the admin for having a link to data from an
      arbitrary schema in the ``LogEntry`` history.

      This type of schema change request should not be done with a POST
      request.

    2. Add a request header::

        X-Change-Schema: <schema-name>

      This will not cause a redirect to the same page without query string. It
      is the only way to do a schema change within a POST request, but could
      be used for any request type.

    3. Use a specific request::

        https://example.com/__change_schema__/<schema-name>/

      This is designed to be used from AJAX requests, or as part of
      an API call, as it returns a status code (and a short message)
      about the schema change request. If you were storing local data,
      and did one of these, you are probably going to have to invalidate
      much of that.

    You could also come up with other methods.
