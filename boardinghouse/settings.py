Models that should be in the public/shared schema,

Overrides for models that should be place in each schema.

This enables us to do magic like have the m2m join table for a pair
of shared models be schema-aware.

Can we annotate a ForeignKey field, or perhaps do something in the
Model.Meta to set this?

Perhaps we could have a SchemaAwareManyToManyField()...
