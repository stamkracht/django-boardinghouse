Development
===========

You can run tests across all supported versions using tox_. Make sure you have a checked-out version of the project from:

https://bitbucket.org/schinckel/django-boardinghouse/

If you have tox installed, then you'll be able to run it from the checked out directory.

Bugs and feature requests can be reported on BitBucket, and Pull Requests may be accepted.
