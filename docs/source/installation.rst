==================
Installation/Usage
==================

Requirements
============

* Django_
* Postgres_
* psycopg2_
* django-model-utils_

This application requires, and depends upon Django_ being installed. Currently, versions from 1.4 to 1.6 are supported, along with South_ for migrations. 

Support for 1.7 is under development. Migrations have changed, so this is not a small task to change.

Postgres is required to allow schema to be used. psycopg2_ is required as per normal Django/Postgres integration.

django-model-utils_ is used for ``PassThroughManager``, which, under Django 1.7 will be replaced by `QuerySet.as_manager() <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/managers/#creating-manager-with-queryset-methods>`_. However, the ``Tracker`` feature is also used to track changes on the :class:`boardinghouse.models.Schema` model, to prevent modification of the `schema` attribute.

Installation and Configuration
==============================

Install it using your favourite installer: mine is `pip`_::

    pip install django-boardinghouse

You will need to add ``boardinghouse`` to your ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``.

If you use South_, you must put it after ``south``. If you use the Django admin, put it before ``django.contrib.admin``. [Check this is still correct under 1.7].

You will need to use the provided database engine in your ``settings.DATABASES``::

    'boardinghouse.backends.postgres'

If you are using South, add the following to your settings::

    SOUTH_DATABASE_ADAPTERS = {
        'default': 'boardinghouse.backends.south_backend',
        'boardinghouse.backends.postgres': 'boardinghouse.backends.south_backend',
    }

You will probably want to modify your ``User`` model so it contains a relationship to :ref:`settings.SCHEMA_MODEL`. The type of relationship depends on your business logic::

  class User(AbstractBaseUser):
      schema = models.ForeignKey(settings.SCHEMA_MODEL)

``django-boardinghouse`` automatically installs a class to your middleware (see :ref:`middleware`), and a context processor (see :ref:`template_variables`). If you have the admin installed, it adds a column to the admin :class:`django.contrib.admin.models.LogEntry` class, to store the object schema when applicable.

It's probably much easier to start using ``django-boardinghouse`` right from the beginning of a project: trying to split an existing database may be possible, but is not supported at this stage.

Usage
=====

Shared Models
-------------

If a model class contains the attribute ``_is_shared_model`` with a truthy value, then it will be deemed to be a shared model, and will be installed into the default (public) schema.

If a model is listed in the :const:`settings.SHARED_MODELS` list, then it is deemed to be a shared model.

All other models are deemed to be schema-specific models, and will be put into each schema that is created.

The default shared models can be seen in:

.. autodata:: boardinghouse.settings.SHARED_MODELS
  :noindex:

.. _settings.SCHEMA_MODEL:

settings.SCHEMA_MODEL
---------------------

The default schema model is :class:`boardinghouse.models.Schema`, you can override this by using ``settings.SCHEMA_MODEL``. Use the ``app_label.model_name`` syntax that you see in django custom user models.

When you are creating

Management commands
-------------------

When ``django-boardinghouse`` has been installed, it will override the following commands:

.. automodule:: boardinghouse.management.commands.syncdb
  :noindex:

.. automodule:: boardinghouse.management.commands.migrate
  :noindex:

.. automodule:: boardinghouse.management.commands.flush
  :noindex:

.. automodule:: boardinghouse.management.commands.loaddata
  :noindex:

.. automodule:: boardinghouse.management.commands.dumpdata
  :noindex:


.. _middleware:

Middleware
----------

The included middleware is always installed:

.. autoclass:: boardinghouse.middleware.SchemaMiddleware
  :noindex:

.. _template_variables:

Template Variables
------------------

There is an included ``CONTEXT_PROCESSOR`` that is always added to the
settings for a project using django-boardinghouse.

.. autofunction:: boardinghouse.context_processors.schemata
  :noindex:

Changing Schema
---------------

As outlined in :ref:`middleware`, there are three ways to change the schema: a ``__schema`` querystring, a request header and a specific request.

These all work without any required additions to your ``urls.py``.
